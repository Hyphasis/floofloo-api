        \               <need>Animals and people have co-existed for thousands of
        years, with animals playing a vital role in natural ecosystems and communities
        across the globe. Despite the strong relationship people have with animals,
        many animals suffer poor welfare. Over 104,000 injured and ill animals reported
        in the past decade within our project location. Free roaming animals are often
        inhumanely treated in misguided attempts to eliminate diseases such as rabies,
        anthrax, tuberculosis, influenza, etc.</need>\n                <notice>Important

        is working hard to address the issue, but there is a chance that we will be

        These vans are also equipped to perform minor surgeries as well as vaccination

        have become the second-leading cause of death among teenagers in the United
        States. More youth die by suicide than from cancer, heart disease, AIDS, birth
        defects, stroke, pneumonia, influenza, and chronic lung disease. Why do people
        die by suicide? People who survive suicide attempts say they wanted to end
        the pain of feeling alone, like a burden, and hopeless. Anyone can be at risk
        of suicide if they become overwhelmed by stress and don't find their way to
        support.</need>\n                <numberOfDonations>279</numberOfDonations>\n
