        this project, we provide treatment and rehabilitation to all diseased and
        distressed animals &amp; birds. We have two separate, fully equipped, multi-specialty
        treatment units for them under the same roof, and every month we treat over
        3000-4000 animals &amp; birds with the help of our facility. Apart from the
        treatment, we conduct various awareness programs for local communities and
        students to improve animal welfare and conservation in our society.\n\nImportant
        Notice about Projects in India: We expect that there will be significant delays
        in getting funds to this project due to new regulatory requirements that impact
        GlobalGiving's ability to disburse to Indian-banked  organizations. GlobalGiving
        is working hard to address the issue, but there is a chance that we will be
        unable to disburse funds to this project. If we cannot disburse funds, donations
        to this project may be reallocated to another organization per our terms and
        conditions.</summary>\n                <themeName>Animal Welfare</themeName>\n

        have become the second-leading cause of death among teenagers in the United
        States. More youth die by suicide than from cancer, heart disease, AIDS, birth
        defects, stroke, pneumonia, influenza, and chronic lung disease. Why do people
        die by suicide? People who survive suicide attempts say they wanted to end
        the pain of feeling alone, like a burden, and hopeless. Anyone can be at risk
        of suicide if they become overwhelmed by stress and don't find their way to
        support.</need>\n                <numberOfDonations>279</numberOfDonations>\n
